Introduction
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share oering. Since then, the program has grown to a eet of
5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can
be unlocked from one station and returned toany other station in the system anytime.
Until now, Cyclisticâ€™s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer
segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the exibility of its pricing plans:
single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day
passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes dierently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to inuence casual riders to become members?
